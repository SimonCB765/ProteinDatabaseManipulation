When running on a Windows system it is best to start the script which will ultimately perform PSI-BLAST from the command prompt as this suppresses the constant popping up of command prompt windows everytime a new sequence is run.

Also should change the packet size allowed by MySQL (I changed it to 32M and stuck the my.ini file in C:\).

The output for the predictions must be called once before the input can occur. This is because the output function -l and -b make the predictions tables.

If you have a protein which does not match any of the proteins in the database generated, then it is possible that you have a non-represetnative UniProt accession.
This can be converted to the representative accession using the AccMap file generated by parseUP.py.
